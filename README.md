# Bird project map rasterisation
Example of rasterisation of maps from coastline shapefiles and generation of density maps from coastline and glacial 
rasters.

## Rasterisation of coastlines

Run rasterising_coastlines.ipynb to convert the shapefiles for each 0.01mya to rasterised maps.

Run generate_density_maps.ipynb to generate the density maps based on the coastline and glacial extent at each time.

Note that I have compressed the original map file so that it takes up less space.

I haven't included the original shapefiles - please extract them to shapefiles/historical_coastlines.
