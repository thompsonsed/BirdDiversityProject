# Bird project map rasterisation
Example of rasterisation of maps from coastline shapefiles and generation of density maps from coastline and glacial 
rasters.

To get this to run, simply run the jupyter notebook. All maps are contained in the data folder.

To extend this script to apply to all rasters in a folder, you will need to match the glacial rasters
with their respective shapefiles. Here I just used a single raster/shapefile (0.01 mya) as an example.

Note that I have compressed the original map file so that it takes up less space.
